# Interview Scheduler
##About
Interview Scheduler is an application that enables users to schedule technical interviews. Developed with React, the front-end interfaces with a database through Axios to facilitate fetching and storage of appointment data. To ensure the application's robustness, it has undergone testing via Storybook, Jest, and Cypress. It is essential to note that this project was created during my training with Lighthouse Labs and is not meant for production use.
